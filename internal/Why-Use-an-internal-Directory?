# Why Use an internal/ Directory?

### Encapsulation and Package Privacy:

- Go treats packages inside the internal/ directory as private to the module in which they are defined. This means that only code inside the same module or repository can import these packages.

- Example:

````
github.com/yourusername/simple-api/
├── cmd/
│   └── main.go
└── internal/
    ├── server/
    └── task/
````


Here, only the code in github.com/yourusername/simple-api can import internal/task and internal/server. If another project tries to import github.com/yourusername/simple-api/internal/task, it will result in a compile-time error.

- This prevents unintended usage of internal logic by external consumers, offering better API boundaries.
